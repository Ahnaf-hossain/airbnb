Webscraping program which collects books from Project Gutenberg and reads it out to the user through googles GTTS library.

To run the file, the program second secondHackTest (1) is to be run. This program has all the gTTS library and the main user interface code. Hack3 is the program that does the webscraping.

When the program asks for the name of the book, the user must say the name of the book out loud. The user is expected to wait 10-15 seconds for the webscraper to get the book ready. 

The book is downlaoded as a .txt file from project gutenberg and then fed into the gTTS library line after line for the library to convert the text into speech.

This program was built as a project at my first hackathon and meant for blind people to be able to access ebooks easily of the web.
